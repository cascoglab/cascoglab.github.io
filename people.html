              Desmond is an assistant professor in the Department of Psychology at the University of Texas at Austin. A cognitive scientist by training, he is interested in how people empathize with and understand the emotions of those around them (Affective Cognition), with the goal of building better technology that can help us become better versions of ourselves, such as through better empathy or better well-being (Affective Computing).

            I received my PhD at Penn State University as part of the Empathy and Moral Psychology lab. I am also a former visiting Crawford fellow in Ethical Inquiry at the Stanford Social Neuroscience Lab at Stanford University. I consider myself a moral psychologist, broadly interested in altruism, empathy, and prosocial behavior, and specifically studying how we think about, are surprised by, and sometimes (negatively) judge the kindness of others.

              Recently having graduated with my BA in Psychology from UT Austin in May 2023, I am interested in social psychology and the impacts our environments have on our cognition. With my minor in sociology, I have grown to be increasingly devoted to understanding how social challenges like implicit biases or other disparities affect our behaviors and our brains. In the CASCog Lab, I believe understanding how machine learning can become biased toward underserved populations is a needed field that must also remain morally and ethically aware.

              My first introduction to research stemmed from a curiosity about the intersection of technology and creative pursuits. In NUS, my research interests have come to center around how we perceive and interpret affective information, as well as how patterns of social connection contribute to outcomes such as performance and wellbeing. In my free time, I love working on music and reading sci-fi.

              I am fascinated by how humans can learn and reason so flexibly and deeply. People are able to develop complex understanding across a vast range of domains: from physical and social environments to a growing list of cultural artefacts like games, politics, academics, etc. In this lab, I build computational models of human cognitive reasoning and causal learning to gain insights into how humans construct working models of their world. I also use learning analytics to study how learning occurs in the classroom and seek to apply scientific knowledge to design better pedagogical methods for students.

                I am a PhD candidate working primarily with the Social Cognition Lab at UT Austin. My primary research program on morality is concerned with understanding (1) factors underlying moral judgments, beliefs, and perceptions, and (2) the consequences of moral disagreements and misguided moral perceptions. My secondary research program on misinformation is concerned with uncovering (1) factors underlying misinformation susceptibility and (2) potential ways of counteracting the problem. I am currently collaborating with the CASCog lab on projects investigating the links between empathy and morality.

              I am passionate about building empathetic AIs that promote people's well-being and productivity. As a fifth-year Ph.D. candidate at Seoul National University, my research interests include using a computational approach (specifically, NLP) to assess empathy, training psychological concepts such as Theory-of-Mind into neural network models, and developing AI chatbots that produce empathetic responses in tune with human preferences. Currently, I am exploring the potential of recent large language models (LLMs) and related methods (e.g., Chain-of-Thought, RLHF) for empathetic conversational AIs.

              Humans are capable of identifying and reasoning about others' emotions. Can we enable computers to do the same? This is the fundamental question that drives my research. Currently, I am working towards modeling emotions at a fine-grained level and transferring knowledge from existing emotion theories into deep-learning models to improve their interpretability. In my free time, I love trying out new recipes and exploring places.

              To construct truly intelligent machines, I believe we should strive to research and innovate beyond mere perception tasks (computer vision, speech recognition etc.) to cognition (e.g. higher order cognition such as emotion detection and modelling). The primary question that I would like to tackle in my work is how do we model theories of emotions in Artificial Intelligence such that the performance of emotion detection is enhanced? Specifically, could we specify domain theories of emotions (e.g. Appraisal Theory) to model emotion detection and reasoning in computers? Other research interests of mine include emotion detection using data from various modes such as facial expressions, text, speech, and physiology.

              Hui Yan is immensely passionate about working with young children, and her strong love for them started at the age of 16 when she decided to pursue her dream and study Early Childhood Education in Ngee Ann Polytechnic. Her main research interests include affective cognition, strategic mindset, and selective trust among young children.

              I am an undergraduate student at the National University of Singapore majoring in Computer Science. I am deeply interested in artificial intelligence and in particular its intersection with human cognition. Research is one of my passions and I plan to pursue graduate studies as well as one day enter academia. I also enjoy video games, writing, and Dungeons & Dragons!

              I am interested in understanding how human learning and cognition can be modelled using computational models, and I am currently looking into how emotions could contribute to the process of humans' causal inference.

              I graduated from the National University of Singapore in 2021 with a B.Sci in Business Analytics. My research interests lie broadly in Affective Computing and I am still exploring on the different aspects of it in the lab. On top of that, I am also interested in exploring how affective computing and data science can be used to help improve learning and education. Currently, I am working on a project that aims to effectively detect engagement levels of students in an online classroom setting like Zoom. Outside of the lab, you will often find me grooving to weird contemp music in my room or then dance studio!
